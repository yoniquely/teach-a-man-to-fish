Continue to refactor UI so it works properly with anchor points
    ~~- Get all screens working~~
    - Make sure UI isn't adjusting position based on visability of Ui elements
    ~~- Add buffer / padding around screen~~
    ~~- Make sure Day progress bar is funcitoning correctly~~
    - Make sure theres no minimum width on game screen
    

Restart on game loss

~~Learn the correct method instead of calling $void~~
Fail sound or visual element when text input for incorrect thing is submitted

hide cursor

add way to quit and reset the game

Get teaching level ups working

Review orignal plans
**Lower Priority**

Reset on idle or exhibition mode that allows that
Refactor input code that checks each frame
Make it so buttons are instead line edits
Refactor code so that there isn't repeated variables in UI. Maybe by removing the Summary screen totally and just playing an animation over the standard game UI
