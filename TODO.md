    ~~- Add buffer / padding around screen~~
    ~~- Make sure Day progress bar is funcitoning correctly~~

GUI that shows fisherman and a dock

Refactor code so that there isn't repeated variables in UI. Maybe by removing the Summary screen totally and just playing an animation over the standard game UI

Summary screen beeps as they show each item changed

Reset on idle or exhibition mode that allows that
